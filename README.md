# SMS Spam Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project is centered around developing a fraud SMS prediction model utilizing the Naive Bayes classifier, a popular algorithm for text classification tasks. The objective is to construct a model capable of accurately discerning between legitimate and fraudulent SMS messages based on various textual and metadata features.

## Dataset
The dataset utilized for this project comprises a labeled collection of SMS messages categorized as either legitimate or fraudulent. The dataset includes features such as text content, sender details, timestamps, and any other relevant metadata.

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preprocessing the text data, extracting relevant features, and handling any class imbalances.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Utilizing techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to represent text data numerically, and extracting meaningful features from metadata.
3. **Model Selection:** Implementing a Naive Bayes classifier suitable for text classification tasks, such as Multinomial Naive Bayes or Bernoulli Naive Bayes.
4. **Model Training:** Training the Naive Bayes classifier on the preprocessed and engineered features.
5. **Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance using evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## Results
The trained Naive Bayes classifier demonstrated robust performance in fraud SMS prediction, achieving high accuracy and reliable metrics across various evaluation criteria. The model's ability to effectively differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent SMS messages is crucial for fraud detection and prevention in communication systems.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project successfully developed a fraud SMS prediction model using the Naive Bayes classifier, showcasing the effectiveness of probabilistic algorithms in text classification tasks. Implementing such models can significantly bolster security measures and protect users from fraudulent activities. Future iterations may explore ensemble methods or deep learning techniques for further improving predictive accuracy and robustness.
